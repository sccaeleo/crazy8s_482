The Crazy Eights project is a web app that allows users to play the Crazy Eights card game. Users can create accounts and log in to keep track of their games and statistics. They can also send friend requests to users, which once accepted by the recipient, allows them to message that user. Users can choose to host or join a multiplayer game of Crazy Eights, and are given options to choose a public or private game, as well as the buy-in they are willing to spend. Once a game is started, each user can act on their turn until the game won or lost.

This project was requested by the client, Eric Ebert, on behalf of `XYZ Enterprises.' He wanted this website created for the purposes of monetizing the game and bringing in more money to his company. The main way the website generates income is through non-intrusive ads.
